# To-Do-List-
A to-do / task list using HTML/CSS/Javascript on the web. This application is not connected to a database and therefore cannot store the information written in the to-do list

Originally, the plan was to implement sentiment analysis to the to-do list when you are writing down items, however after research I realized that I would have to understand some ML and neural networks for NLP. This project is no longer being worked on, but I may return in the future
